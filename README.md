# Rust-Handbook
Welcome to the **Rust Handbook**! This guide is a record of my personal journey as I learn the Rust programming language. Throughout this book, I will document my experiences, challenges, and progress as I dive deeper into Rust, while providing examples, explanations, and lessons learned along the way.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency. It's a great choice for those who want to write fast, memory-safe, and reliable code. Whether you're interested in low-level programming or building scalable applications, Rust has you covered.

- **Memory safety** without a garbage collector.
- **Concurrency** made easy without the usual pitfalls.
- **Zero-cost abstractions** that don’t sacrifice performance.

This book is an ongoing project that serves as a personal documentation of my learning process and a way to reflect on the things I’ve learned.

## Who is this book for?

This book is written for anyone who:

- Is new to Rust and looking for a structured way to learn the language.
- Has experience with other programming languages and wants to explore Rust’s unique features.
- Enjoys hands-on learning with practical examples.

## Structure of the Book

The book is organized into chapters, each focusing on specific topics that will help you get started and deepen your knowledge of Rust. Here's an overview of the structure:

1. **Introduction to Rust** – A brief introduction to the language, its history, and why it’s so popular.
2. **Getting Started with Rust** – How to install Rust and set up your development environment.
3. **Basic Syntax and Data Types** – Covering variables, types, functions, and control flow.
4. **Memory Management** – Exploring Rust's ownership model, borrowing, and lifetimes.
5. **Error Handling** – Working with `Result` and `Option` types to handle errors.
6. **Concurrency in Rust** – How Rust makes it safe and easy to write concurrent programs.
7. **Projects** – A section with hands-on projects, such as the Guessing Game project.

Throughout this book, you'll also find **exercises** and **practical examples** to help reinforce your learning.
